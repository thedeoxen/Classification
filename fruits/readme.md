# Fresh and Rotten/Stale Fruits and Vegetables Classification Dataset

### Description
The Fresh and Rotten/Stale Fruits and Vegetables Classification Dataset is a curated collection of high-quality images designed to train and evaluate classification models for accurately distinguishing between fresh and rotten/stale produce. The dataset includes a diverse range of commonly found fruits and vegetables, such as apples, oranges, bananas, tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, and more. Each item in the dataset is captured in multiple images, representing both fresh and rotten/stale states. This diversity ensures the generalization and robustness of the classification models.
